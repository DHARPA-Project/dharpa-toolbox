    "Jupyter notebooks have (relatively) little value to other researchers, and re-usability is low. This is an acceptable\n",
    "trade-off though, because the problems they are solving are (usually) very niche and specific, so there is little downside\n",

    "itself, and communicate what is happening to the data (which is important for publication).\n",

    "If we want to create a tool that lets users run pre-created workflows, that equation changes though. Because, now the assumption\n",

    "areas where people have (roughly) the same problem, and to solve that problem in a generic way that is useful to a\n",

    "One other point that is important to note is user interactivity. Usually, when developing a Jupyter notebook inputs (data as well\n",
    "as parameters) are either hardcoded, or factored out into a variable that is changed on top of the notebook (or in some cells\n",
    "further down). And by running or re-running certain cells, those variables are re-set or changed. This works fine for\n",
    "dynamically creating a workflow (although, it's sometimes confusing, and one of the main criticisms against the Jupyter notebook\n",

    "is currently inconsistent after a user-input, and have a way to communicating that to the user so they can kick off\n",
    "some re-processing manually, to make it consistent again. Jupyter supports interactivity via widgets, but the 'cell-based'\n",
    "approach in notebooks is not a very good fit for that, because it forces a very simple one-after-the other processing model,\n",
    "that would make it hard to implement the efficient execution of even remotely non-trivial workflows (for example having\n",
    "parallel execution of some cells, or skipping the execution of parts that don't need to be executed currently, etc.)."

    "### Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "- each interactive workflow is automatically a 'batch-style' one\n",
    "- ability to work on different parts of the application almost 100% independently (workflow engine, workflow renderers (UIs), plugins (submitting long running jobs to a cluster, metadata augmentation/data lineage, metric gathering, ...)\n",
    "- comparatively little dependencies for the base system / lightweight, but very extensible\n",
    "- no dependency on any one UI/frontend technology (can use Jupyter/React/QT/...), can run without any UI at all\n",
    "- complex workflow can be broken up into separate pieces, and developed and tested individually\n",
    "- fairly high re-usablity\n",
    "- easy to use in an agile, iterative development process\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "- potentially lower performance due to having to create copies of inputs/outputs to make sure they (or items contained within them) are not changed by subsequent steps\n",
    "- harder to create very customized UIs\n",
    "- there's a limit to the complexity of workflows that can be supported realistically (e.g. hard to implement control structures like if-then-else or loops on a workflow level/outside of modules -- but in a lot of cases that is probably not necessary)"
